# GoHighLevel Workflow Management

This project provides comprehensive workflow management capabilities for GoHighLevel, allowing you to programmatically manage automation sequences and lead nurturing workflows.

## üéØ What Are Workflows?

Workflows in GoHighLevel are automation sequences that can be triggered by various events in your system. They help you:

- **Automate lead nurturing** - Send follow-up emails, SMS, and calls
- **Manage lead progression** - Move contacts through your sales pipeline
- **Handle appointments** - Send confirmations and reminders
- **Engage realtors** - Outreach and partnership campaigns
- **Manage DND (Do Not Disturb)** - Respect contact preferences
- **Track engagement** - Monitor who's responding and who's not

## üìä Your Current Workflow Setup

### üî• Popular Workflow Categories:
1. **Lead Management** - New lead processing and assignment
2. **Appointment Scheduling** - Booking confirmations and reminders
3. **Follow-up Sequences** - Automated follow-up campaigns
4. **Nurture Campaigns** - Long-term lead nurturing
5. **Realtor Outreach** - Partner relationship management
